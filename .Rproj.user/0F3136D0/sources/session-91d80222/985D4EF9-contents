# Definition of terms

* **Variability** - The degree of how values are spread out in a distribution.

# Abstract


Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

# Introduction

## Background Information

The LEGO foundation is committed to supporting children holistically, for inclusive outcomes of children. Measurement is key for this achievement. 
Through support from RTI and NYU Global TIES for children, a PLAY toolkit was developed
The tools measure how teachers and caregivers support children’s engagement in their learning. PLAY toolkit was used in rural schools in Bangladesh


#  Methodology
## Sample Area
The pilot data and IRR data collection were both carried out in Ukhia, an Upazila in Cox's Bazar District of Bangladesh.

## Data Analysis 
The cardinal aim of conducting data analysis across the the PLAY toolkit is to determine presence of common constructs that contribute self-sustained engagement and learning through PLAY across the contexts.^[4]^ Therefore, data analysis approach will employ a procedure that consists of five steps.^[5]^ These are: 

* Descriptive statistics and correlations of items across the constructs.
* Tests for reliability across all the instruments.
* Exploratory factor analysis with an aim of understanding the structure of the items regardless of their pre-assigned constructs.
* Confirmatory factor analysis with an aim of examining optimal statistical model fits/coefficients.
* Examine the relationships among different instruments. An optional approach that explores relationships among PLAY instruments and their corresponding results.
