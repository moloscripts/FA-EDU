# Enrolment data analysis


## Enrolment per age group
The total number of enrolled students was 7710. Out of these, 56% (4,338) were male learners and 44% (3,372) were female learners. Enrolment per lot saw 51% (3,905) of all learners were in Lot 1, and 49%(3,805) of all learners were in lot 2. The highest number of enrolment in Lot 1 was accounted for by male learners in the age group of 8-10, with a total of 1,271, this represented 33% of the enrolment. Second were male learners still in the age group of 8-10 accounting for 27% (1,047) of  the enrolment. The figure below shows the total count of enrolment across learners in Lot 1. Classified per age group and gender.

In lot 2, male learners across the age group of 8-10 were the most common learners accounting for 28% (1,056) of all the total learners. This was closely followed by female learners of the same age group accounting for 24% (910). The below graph shows the distribution of learners in Lot 2 across the age groups, per gender.

```

Furthermore, the district that exhibited the highest dropout rate is Nanumba South, with 73 learners being female learners and 70 being male learners. Top communities within this district that had the highest dropout rates were Nakpayili, Koyaja, and Juali.

Below is a district-wise table showing the rate of dropout across all lots.
